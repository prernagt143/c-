/*"Imagine you're responsible for calculating electricity bills for households. Each household consumes electricity, and the bill varies based on the number of units consumed. The bill calculation involves different rates for different ranges of units consumed, along with an additional surcharge.

Write a program  to input electricity unit charges and calculate the total electricity bill according to the given condition:
For the first 50 units Rs. 0.50/unit
For the next 100 units Rs. 0.75/unit
For the next 100 units Rs. 1.20/unit
For units above 250 Rs. 1.50/unit
An additional surcharge of 20% is added to the bill

Tips:

1. Understand how the bill amount varies for different ranges of units consumed.
2. Pay attention to adding the surcharge correctly to the total bill amount.
3. Ensure accuracy in calculations and handle different scenarios effectively.

Input:
200
Output:
192"*/
